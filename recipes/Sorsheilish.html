    <h2><u>Ingredients:</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>750 gm. Hilsa fish (cut into 6-7 pieces)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon black mustard seeds</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon yellow mustard seeds</li>
        <li>4 large green chillies</li>
        <li>100 ml. mustard oil + a few drops to finish</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon nigella seeds</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><u>Steps:</u></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Soak the mustard seeds in warm water for at least 1 hour, preferably.</li>
      <li> Strain and make a paste with 1/4th teaspoon salt and 1 large green chilli. The paste should not be runny, so its ideal to use a sil or mortar or pestle to make this paste.</li>
      <li>Apply salt and turmeric powder on hilsa fish. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Reserve 2 tablespoon of the mustard oil. Heat the remaining oil. Fry the hilsa on both sides over medium high heat till light golden (about 30-35 seconds per side). Remove and put them aside.</li>
      <li>To the remaining mustard oil, add 1 tablespoon of the fried hilsa oil, and heat it over high heat till the oil is really hot but not smoking. Add the nigella seeds, lower the heat to a simmer, and immediately add the mustard paste and 1/4th teaspoon turmeric, followed by 1 cup water.</li>
      <li> Once the water starts boiling, add the fish and green chillies. You can slit a couple of them to add to the heat. Then, add salt to taste. Stir everything up, cover and cook over simmering heat for 8-10 minutes. Add a few drops of raw mustard oil, then cover and turn off the heat.</li>
      <li> Let it cook in its own steam for another 5 minutes, then serve with hot rice.</li>
